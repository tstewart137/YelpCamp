# Udemy "YelpCamp" project
This code base reflects the required end-of-class project from Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp 2023. It is meant to be a Yelp-like app for campers.
Notable points include the use of free-for-student-use API's like Cloudinary for image storage and MapBox. The database is MongoDB.
It is deployed to heroku & MongoDB but I keep it offline to avoid charges.
